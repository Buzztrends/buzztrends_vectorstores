Its orbit expands by an inch and a half each year.\\n\\nThe Moon has been Earth’s companion for approximately 4.6 billion years, since the birth of the Solar System. In ancient times, humans were fascinated by the Moon’s ever-changing position, shape, and its periodic disappearance from the sky during its 29-day cycle. Early civilizations, particularly in the Stone Age, documented the various phases of the Moon, using its observations as a means to mark the passage of days and anticipate the changing seasons. The reliable tracking of time was crucial for essential activities like agriculture and hunting, laying the foundation for human civilization.\\n\\nNotably, ancient societies, including those responsible for structures like Stonehenge, incorporated lunar cycles into their calendar systems. The positioning of stones at sites like Stonehenge suggests a connection to lunar phenomena. These early calendars not only served as tools for tracking time but also influenced the determination of when the year should commence and how to subdivide it into smaller units. While the contemporary Gregorian calendar is based on the solar year, it’s essential to recognize that the earliest calendar systems were rooted in the lunar cycle.\\n\\nAlso Read Vijaybhoomi University signs MoU for research collaboration with the Indian Institute of Science\\n\\nHistory of Moon Exploration\\n\\nThe initial era of lunar exploration unfolded amid the geopolitical competition of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. In 1959, the Soviets achieved a notable milestone with Luna 1, marking the first spacecraft to break free from Earth’s gravity and approach the moon within approximately 4,000 miles. Subsequent Soviet missions, such as Luna 2, made strides by establishing contact with the moon’s surface, with Luna 2 crash-landing in the Mare Imbrium basin, yielding valuable insights. Concurrently, the United States entered the lunar exploration arena with NASA’s Ranger spacecraft, executing nine missions between 1961 and 1965. These missions provided close-up views and crucial data, aiding scientists in understanding the moon’s rough terrain and identifying potential landing sites for future human missions.\\n\\nHow is time calculated on the moon?\\n\\nOn the Moon, time is a bit different than what we experience on Earth. Unlike our 24-hour day, a day on the Moon, called a lunar day, lasts about 29.5 Earth days. This is because it takes the Moon about 29.5 days to complete one full rotation on its axis. So, if you were standing on the Moon, you would see the Sun rise and set over a period of nearly 30 Earth days.\\n\\nTo measure shorter intervals, like hours and minutes, scientists and astronauts use a system similar to ours. They’ve divided the lunar day into 24 “hours,” and each “hour” is further divided into 60 “minutes.” However, these lunar hours and minutes are much longer than our Earth hours and minutes.\\n\\nInterestingly, due to the lack of a significant atmosphere on the Moon, there’s no natural way to define days and nights based on sunlight. Instead, temperatures can vary wildly between the extremely hot lunar day and the bitterly cold lunar night. This unique way of experiencing time adds an extra layer of challenge and fascination to any lunar activities or missions.\\n\\nWhat time is it on the Moon and why should we care?\\n\\n“For the many nations, international alliances, and companies investing in future opportunities on and around the Moon, the answer (or lack thereof) may have serious implications,” US based Ben Ogden, Professor of Strategic Space Studies, says .\\n\\nAccording to Prof Ogden, “On Earth, aside from a few anomalies, the global community uses 24 geographical time zones aligned with Earth’s rotation as well as a Coordinated Universal Time (CUT) to synchronize timekeeping (most effectively by means of GPS satellite signals). This precise timing harmony enables our technologically modern world to function at its peak.”\\n\\n“Assured timing and tempo will mean everything to the long list of interested stakeholders looking to revolutionize human presence and activity on the lunar surface and its associated orbits. So, the spacefaring community needs a common timekeeping governance to avoid operational degradation, disruption, miscalculation, embarrassment, and even catastrophe before the next lunar footprints are set.\\n\\nOtherwise, travelers to the so-called “Eighth Continent” might experience something a little more serious than a bad case of jetlag,” he states.\\n\\nLunar Exploration\\n\\nHumans have been fascinated by the moon since ancient times, gazing up at its luminous presence in the night sky. The earliest recorded observations of the moon date back to ancient civilizations, where it often held cultural and religious significance. However, it wasn’t until the invention of the telescope in the 17th century that detailed lunar exploration began.\\n\\nIn 1609, Galileo Galilei turned his telescope to the moon, revealing its cratered surface and mountains. This marked a crucial milestone in our understanding of Earth’s celestial companion. Over the centuries, various lunar missions and scientific advancements further fueled our interest in lunar exploration.\\n\\nThe space race of the 20th century played a pivotal role in intensifying our lunar curiosity. The Apollo program by NASA, initiated in 1961, aimed to land humans on the moon. On July 20, 1969, the Apollo 11 mission achieved this historic feat, with astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin becoming the first humans to set foot on the lunar surface.\\n\\nIn the 21st century, renewed interest in lunar exploration has emerged, driven by technological advancements, international collaborations, and the pursuit of scientific knowledge. The moon serves as a valuable platform for studying planetary processes, conducting space experiments, and potentially establishing a future human presence beyond Earth. This ongoing curiosity about the moon reflects humanity’s enduring quest for understanding and exploring the mysteries of the cosmos.', 'top_image': 'https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/moon-12.jpg', 'topic': 'SCIENCE', 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbmFuY2lhbGV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2xpZmUvc2NpZW5jZS1sdW5hci1teXN0ZXJpZXMtZnJvbS1hbmNpZW50LWNhbGVuZGFycy10by0yMXN0LWNlbnR1cnktZXhwbG9yYXRpb24tMzMyNzA5OC_SAX5odHRwczovL3d3dy5maW5hbmNpYWxleHByZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlL3NjaWVuY2UtbHVuYXItbXlzdGVyaWVzLWZyb20tYW5jaWVudC1jYWxlbmRhcnMtdG8tMjFzdC1jZW50dXJ5LWV4cGxvcmF0aW9uLTMzMjcwOTgvbGl0ZS8?oc=5'}),\n",

Back then it was thought to comprise a single cluster of galaxies, concentrated at a single distance. However, further research revealed that the original Abell cluster is actually comprised of two independent galaxy clusters - a foreground group around 2.3 billion light-years from Earth, and another group at a greater distance of about 5.4 billion light-years away from us.\\n\\nThe more distant galaxy cluster, included in the Massive Cluster Survey as MCS J0358.8-2955, takes central stage in this Hubble image. The two galaxy groups are thought to have masses equivalent to around 30 trillion and 120 trillion times the mass of our Sun, respectively. Both of the two largest galaxies at the center of this image are part of MCS J0358.8-2955.

For part four, we made our way to the land of forts and palaces to immerse ourselves in the grandeur of what is perhaps one of Rajasthan’s lesser-known forts, but certainly one of the most iconic not just in the region, but in India as well. The Delhi-Vadodara-Mumbai Expressway has helped cut down travel time to Bundi by around 90 minutes.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nOur companion for the roughly 450km journey to Bundi from our base in Noida was the new Hyundai Aura, one of India’s most popular compact sedans. Around 270km of that is along the brand new Delhi-Vadodara-Mumbai Expressway or NE4, which has helped reduce travel time by at least 90 minutes compared to the older route. The exit for Lalsot is where one needs to get off the expressway, mostly because the road ahead isn’t properly ready yet.\\n\\nBesides the convenience of driving along a world-class expressway, the feature-rich Hyundai Aura equipped with cruise control made life easier, munching miles effortlessly. While the roads after exiting the expressway are good too, if you’re driving through Rajasthan via State and National Highways, try avoiding doing so after sunset to minimize the risk posed by stubborn stray cows sitting in the middle of the roads here. This road leads to the entry point located next to the Bundi TV tower for the upper sections of the Taragarh Fort.\\n\\nBundi presents itself as a small town with the quintessential Rajasthani vibe, chief contributors to which are the remnants of its storied past scattered all over. Bundi’s crown jewel is the Taragarh Fort, pictured above. Spread across a hillside, the fort complex houses several places of interest, including the Garh Palace or Bundi Mahal and Chitrashala. The upper portion of the fort complex houses Rani Mahal and several stepwells, but is in dire need of some upkeep to make it more visitor-friendly.\\n\\nOur exploration of Bundi led us to the entry gate located towards the top of the fort complex which, based on the general lack of upkeep and overgrown foliage, suggests it isn’t the preferred port of entry for most visitors. Inside, there’s Rani Mahal, presumably where the queen would reside, but it too seemed in dire need of attention. Bundi town and portions of the Garh Palace as seen from the upper sections of Taragarh Fort.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThis portion of the fort did offer splendid views of Bundi and the surrounding area, though, and while one can walk down all the way to the more popular sections of the fort, Garh Palace and Chitrashala, the staff advised against doing so because it wouldn’t just have been extremely tiring climbing all the way back up to where the Aura was parked, but would also leave us susceptible to encounters with the monkeys that call the Taragarh Fort their home. While the journey up to Bundi was smooth sailing, the roads within the town put the Aura's ride quality to the test.\\n\\nTo get to the main entrance located in the city, we had to drive around the hill this fort is built on and that didn’t turn out to be as straightforward a task as it seems. Potholes the size of craters was challenge number one, followed by Bundi’s narrow streets which, at times, were barely wide enough for the Aura. While the journey up to Bundi had been smooth sailing in terms of road quality, this proved to be a real test of the Aura’s ride quality and the sedan left us properly impressed with how it dealt with these roads.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nLegendary English novelist, Rudyard Kipling, who is said to have spent considerable time in Bundi, mentions Bundi Palace or Garh Palace in Letter of Marque - “Jaipur Palace may be called the Versailles of India.â\\x80æ.Jodhpur’s House of strife, grey towers on red rock, is the work of giants, but the Palace of Bundi, even in broad daylight, is such a palace as men build for themselves in uneasy dreams – the work of goblins rather than of men.” The main attractions housed within the Taragarh Fort complex are far more easily accessible, with their entrance located inside the town of Bundi. Hathi Pol, Garh Palace and Chitrashala showcase incredible craftsmanship with their sculptures and painted walls and ceilings, which one can easily spend hours admiring.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nWelcoming visitors into Garh Palace is the magnificent Haathi Pol, passing through which reveals immaculately maintained gardens, a stark contrast to what we had encountered earlier towards the top of the fort complex. Within these walls are Chattar Mahal, Phool Mahal and Badal Mahal, each boasting a unique style of architecture, beautifully crafted structures and gorgeous hand-painted walls and ceiling. Chitrashala, declared as a protected monument by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), was the most mesmerizing portion of Taragarh Fort, at least for us. The painted walls and ceiling within this space showcase exemplary artwork that wouldn’t be out of place in any of the world’s finest art galleries.\\n\\nTaragarh Fort’s magnificence and the easy-going aura of Bundi certainly made the journey worth the 6-7 hour drive. It also helped highlight just how well-rounded the Hyundai Aura is as a product at this price point offering comfort, space and a host of convenience features along with the safety net of six airbags, ESC, hill start assist and three-point seat belts for all five occupants. More cars, more adventures and more iconic sites await us. So, stay tuned for the next part of the Icons of India series. The Hadoti region of Rajasthan, nestled amongst the Aravallis, serves up breathtaking views in spades.\\n\\nHyundai Aura owner's perspective\\n\\n“I am very happy with the car and every day spent with it reinforces the fact that I picked the right car”, says Purushottam Rathi, a proud owner of the Hyundai Aura. Comfort, space and efficiency were the top priorities for him while looking for a sedan, and he found the perfect match in the form of the CNG variant of the Hyundai Aura. Purushottam Rathi with his Hyundai Aura CNG\\n\\n“Low running cost was very important to me and this, I think, is the best CNG compact sedan currently available in the market”, he added. Playing a crucial role in Purushottam zeroing in on the Aura was the Hyundai badge that, according to him, brings with it a peace of mind with regard to quality, resale value and after-sales support that most brands just cannot match.\", 'top_image': 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202312/hyundai-aura-icons-of-india-taragarh-fort-055725705-16x9_0.png?VersionId=oVuBdDSPtmV_xfyctEa_2AZrN7LGW2tB', 'topic': 'TECHNOLOGY', 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdG9kYXkuaW4vYXV0by9jYXJzL3N0b3J5L2h5dW5kYWktYXVyYS1pY29ucy1vZi1pbmRpYS10YXJhZ2FyaC1mb3J0LWJ1bmRpLTI0NzIwMDgtMjAyMy0xMi0wNdIBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdG9kYXkuaW4vYW1wL2F1dG8vY2Fycy9zdG9yeS9oeXVuZGFpLWF1cmEtaWNvbnMtb2YtaW5kaWEtdGFyYWdhcmgtZm9ydC1idW5kaS0yNDcyMDA4LTIwMjMtMTItMDU?oc=5'}),\n",

This sample, a small quantity of dark dust and granules, was collected by NASA's Osiris-Rex spacecraft, which visited Bennu, an over 4.5 billion-year-old asteroid located about 200 million miles from Earth. The mission retrieved over 60 grams of material, the most extraterrestrial matter brought back to Earth since the Apollo program.\\n\\nPreliminary analysis by NASA scientists indicates that the asteroid contains carbon and water, with some carbon in organic compounds. This finding supports theories suggesting that carbon-rich asteroids like Bennu might have played a crucial role in delivering key components to early Earth, possibly aiding in the formation of oceans and the initiation of life.\\n\\nOne focus of the upcoming research is to analyze hydrogen isotopes in the water from the sample to see if it matches Earth's oceans, offering clues about how Earth acquired its water.

Despite its small size, the sample is expected to yield significant insights into the solar system's formation, the origins of water on Earth, and potentially strategies for dealing with asteroids that threaten our planet. This research could lead to groundbreaking discoveries about the nature of life, Earth, and the universe.\", 'top_image': 'https://dnd2oi6izkvoi.cloudfront.net/2023/12/03/image/jpeg/ByTWiVQLB6popA3HmQmvQwQdiWeVuVG8MPkLuUtk.jpg', 'topic': 'SCIENCE', 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL2ludGVyZXN0aW5nZW5naW5lZXJpbmcuY29tL2llLW9yaWdpbmFscy9pZS1leHBsYWluZXIvc2Vhc29uLTYvZXAtNS10aGlzLXRpbnktYXN0ZXJvaWQtc2FtcGxlLWNhbi1yZXZlYWwtdGhlLXRydXRoLWFib3V0LW91ci11bml2ZXJzZdIBAA?oc=5'}),\n",

(Image Credit: NASA/Goddard/SwRI/Johns Hopkins APL/NOIRLab).\\n\\nThe Lucy spacecraft discovered a surprise moonlet in orbit around Dinkinesh (nicknamed Dinky) during a flyby on November 1. The International Astronomical Union has now approved of the name Selam for the moonlet, which means ‘peace’ in Amharic, a language from Ethiopia. Just as the Lucy spacecraft itself was named after a famous hominin fossil, Selam is the name of a fossil that is considered to be Lucy’s baby. Astronomer Raphael Marshall who originally identified Dinky as a target for the mission said, “Dinkinesh is the Ethiopian name for the fossil nicknamed ‘Lucy.’ It seemed appropriate to name its satellite in honor of another fossil that is sometimes called Lucy’s baby.”\\n\\nThe Selam fossil belongs to a three year old girl, who was the same species as Lucy, but actually lived about 100,000 years before Lucy. The surprising thing about Selam is that it is not just one moonlet, but actually a pair of moonlets of almost equal size, known as a contact binary. Astronomer Jessica Sunshine says, “We were extremely surprised to discover that Dinkinesh appears to have not just one but two moons in its orbit. In that way, this was bonus science since we were expecting only one asteroid but found three. Our flyby was a three-for-one deal.”\\n\\nAlso Read | NASA finds water, carbon in asteroid Bennu sample returned by Osiris spacecraft\\n\\nNASA’s Lucy spacecraft is on its way to study the Trojan moons of Jupiter, which are asteroids captured from the main belt between the Red Planet and the gas giant. There are two swarms of Trojan asteroids, one leading and one trailing the planet during its orbit around the Sun. Lucy will be visiting multiple targets in both the leading and the trailing swarm. The flyby of Dinky was an opportunistic addition to the mission, to use a suitably small asteroid to test the tracking systems on the spacecraft, to ensure that the scientific instruments on board are pointed in the right direction during the high velocity encounters. Lucy will next be encountering the main belt asteroid DonaldJohanson in 2025.\\n\\nAlso Read | Fragments of Moon can become asteroids that threaten Earth', 'top_image': 'https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image_2023-12-03_144906263-Cropped.png', 'topic': 'SCIENCE', 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3M5bGl2ZS5jb20vc2NpZW5jZS9zdXJwcmlzZS1jb21wYW5pb24tdG8tbHVjeXMtZmlyc3QtYXN0ZXJvaWQtdGFyZ2V0LWRpbmtpbmVzaC1ub3ctaGFzLWEtbmFtZS1zZWxhbS0yMzY3MzA00gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3czlsaXZlLmNvbS9zY2llbmNlL3N1cnByaXNlLWNvbXBhbmlvbi10by1sdWN5cy1maXJzdC1hc3Rlcm9pZC10YXJnZXQtZGlua2luZXNoLW5vdy1oYXMtYS1uYW1lLXNlbGFtLTIzNjczMDQvYW1w?oc=5'}),\n",

He learned about it from a headline.\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: I think I said, \"Apparently, (laugh) we\\'re writing a movie called Barbie.\"\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Yeah. I said, \"Ooh. Whoops.\" (laugh)\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: I couldn\\'t even fathom it. (laugh)\\n\\nNoah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig 60 Minutes\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Well, I mean, his issue with it was that there was no character and there was no story.\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: Well, I don\\'t-- I didn\\'t mind that so much as that--\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: You did.\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: --you know, that it was Barbie.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: You told me, \"There\\'s no character and there\\'s no story.\" (laugh)\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: Wait.

And then -\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: Did you actually try to get out of it?\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Yeah.\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: I made -I made some calls. (laugh) And then -\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: It didn\\'t work? (laugh)\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: No-- because Greta was persistent and Greta saw something.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: I did.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: Greta, what was it you saw?\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: You know, Barbie\\'s been around since 1959, and everyone knows who she is, and everyone has an opinion, and she\\'s run the gamut of being ahead of time, behind time. She\\'s a hero, she\\'s a villain.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig 60 Minutes\\n\\nTogether they created their version of Barbie Land…a feminist utopia. Where every woman is Barbie…and every Ken- is just an accessory.\\n\\nBut an existential crisis in Barbie Land, sends Barbie and Ken into the real world.\\n\\nKen wanders off… discovers patriarchy– and likes it.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: There were people that came out after the movie and said, \"Oh. This movie is anti-man.\"\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: The movie is meant to be a big-hearted thing, even though it\\'s poking fun at everyone. But I had this-- but this is-- but I planned this in my head. I\\'ll just say it.\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: OK.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: But I thought, \"Well, this is not man-hating anymore than Aristophanes\\'s Lysistrata (laugh) was man-hating,\" which is-- does not sound like a sick burn when you say it out loud like that.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: That\\'ll teach \\'em.\\n\\nGerwig invoked a Greek playwright to defend barbie. We noticed her mind seems to percolate with literary references. Baumbach\\'s take on the \"Barbie\" backlash was simpler.\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: I felt men could take it. I mean, t-- come on. (laugh)\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: I mean this sounds so silly to say out loud but I love ken. We love Ken. We also take Ken\\'s position quite seriously.\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: Absolutely.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: I think, like, he has no identity outside of her.\\n\\nGerwig and Baumbach live in New York and wrote the screenplay at home during the pandemic.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: Were you entertaining each other?\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Yes.\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: Yeah. I mean, it kind of kept us sane.\\n\\nOr the insanity went into the movie. They told us the final cut -which at times looks like a COVID fever dream- is very close to the script they submitted to Mattel. The toy maker- they say- was surprisingly hands off– but had notes.\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: One of the notes was, \"On page 112, does a Mattel executive have to be shot?\"\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: And I felt like that was exciting. We knew we were onto something.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: We felt like we might as well go for broke. They\\'re already not making movies.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: You thought it might not ever get made? Yeah.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Yeah. Oh, no. We thought it might never get made.\\n\\nSharyn Alfosni and Greta Gerwig 60 Minutes\\n\\nAnd she says she never dreamed - she\\'d be the one who ended up directing it. Greta Gerwig grew up in Sacramento and fell in love with community theater in grade school. She took up dancing, then acting.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: Did you know you would end up in New York?\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: I–I wanted to be in New York but I just didn\\'t know that I-- it was possible. I mean, it felt (noise) extremely far away and expensive.\\n\\nShe attended Barnard College, performed in school productions. then, fell in with a group of low-budget filmmakers - before setting her sights on a wider audience.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: I remember I walked into a casting director\\'s office. It was, sort of, the heyday of, like-- just a certain look on network television, which I was never very good at doing. I don\\'t know why. But I was wearing overalls. And I remember they-\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: A bold choice. (laugh)\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: She looked up and she goes, \"You must be very talented.\" (laughter)\\n\\nShe landed roles in more than a dozen movies. Some she helped write. Then, Greta Gerwig made the biggest leap of her career from indie darling…to breakout director with \"Lady Bird.\"\\n\\nGerwig wrote the coming-of-age story about the complicated relationship between a mother and daughter.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: The scene where she jumps out of the car, (chuckle) what was your direction?\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: I want you to, without even think about it, just-- just hurl yourself out of this ca-- like, I want it to be almost like you\\'ve acted before you\\'ve thought through completely what the result (chuckle) of this is gonna be.\\n\\nGerwig\\'s fearless approach…earned the then 34-year-old two Oscar nominations.\\n\\nTwo years later, she got a third nomination…for her 2019 adaptation of \"Little Women.\"\\n\\nThen, came \"Barbie\"…with a budget more than ten times that of \"Lady Bird.\"\\n\\nLast month, at a theater in New York, Gerwig showed us some of the old musicals that inspired her…including 1957\\'s \"Funny Face.\"\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Look at the way they\\'re standing. That\\'s not humans Like, those are dancers. That\\'s what I wanted all the Barbies and Kens to look like.\\n\\n\"Barbie\" has that technicolor soundstage look because Gerwig convinced the studio to build one, complete with a painted sky and backdrop to give the movie a 2D effect.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Basically-- the foreground is-- that\\'s on a treadmill. So that\\'s going like this to create movement. And then the lines on the road are being pulled by a person behind it. And it\\'s about showing the work. I wanted to see that it was authentically artificial. Really fake. It\\'s about kids. It\\'s about playing with toys. The language of play has to be part of it.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: We shot this whole thing in one day.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: No.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Yeah. We shot it in one day. We had one day to get it. They were like, if you really want this dream ballet, you\\'re gonna get one day.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: As you sit here in the theater today, it\\'s still amazing to you?\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Yeah. I mean, honestly, the whole movie, when I watch it, I-- I still can\\'t believe anybody let me do this. (laugh)\\n\\nGerwig says they wrote the role of Ken specifically for Ryan Gosling.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: Did you know him?\\n\\nBoth: No.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: I\\'d never met him.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: I mean, you wrote his name, Ryan, in the script?\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Yes. It said, \"Ken: Ryan Gosling.\"\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: It was his full name.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Every other (overtalk) Yeah. We just put his whole name in the whole time.\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: It was a lot to type all the time. (laugh)\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: Did he instantly say, like, \"Yes. I\\'m Ken\"?\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: I basically was like, \"Listen. We\\'ve seen the future. You\\'re in it. And you\\'re Ken.\" (laugh)\\n\\nHang around with Greta Gerwig long enough and a pattern emerges.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Now you\\'re going to see how I get people to do things.\\n\\nShe has a way of coaxing people out of their comfort zones. At a dance studio in Midtown Manhattan…\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Why don\\'t you just come try it though. Just come try it.\\n\\nSharyn Alfosni and Greta Gerwig at a Manhattan dance studio 60 Minutes\\n\\nGerwig directed me to join her as she got back into the swing of one of her first loves…tap dancing.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: This is actually a Proustian moment (laugh)\\n\\nA Proustian moment…during something called a paradiddle. The only thing to do was step aside.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: You\\'re a bit of a perfectionist?\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: I guess so, yes.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: But you\\'re, like, another take, another take, another take.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Yeah. Yeah. Of course, yeah.\\n\\nOn the set of \"Barbie,\" Gerwig directed nearly 50 takes of this scene with America Ferrera…who plays a Mattel assistant and mother.\\n\\nSoul-baring monologues, penned by Gerwig, are a staple of her films. The writer\\'s version of a guitar solo.\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: Greta will go into some monologue mode, it\\'s kind of almost physical. Like, she goes in and she just like-- and kind of like, (laugh) doing a thing and, like, you know, it\\'s like Joe Cocker or something. (laugh) it\\'s like -and then, she hands it over. And-- and it\\'s great.\\n\\nNext, Gerwig is taking on a big franchise. She\\'s directing and writing two \"Chronicles of Narnia\" movies. She confessed putting her stamp on the beloved C.S. Lewis classics is giving her nightmares.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Yeah, whenever I\\'m stuck, I go for walks--\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: Do you get--\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: --which is most of the time?\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: Do you get stuck?\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: That\\'s all I\\'ve been--\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: I feel like its flowing out of you–\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: That\\'s all I do. I only get stuck. That\\'s all I re-- that\\'s why I\\'m always going on walks. (laugh)\\n\\nWhatever she\\'s doing, it\\'s paying off. Greta Gerwig is the first woman to solo-direct a billion dollar movie…an idea that once seemed as far-fetched as Barbie in Birkenstocks.\\n\\nProduced by Nathalie Sommer.

(laugh)\\n\\nNoah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig 60 Minutes\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Well, I mean, his issue with it was that there was no character and there was no story.\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: Well, I don\\'t-- I didn\\'t mind that so much as that--\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: You did.\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: --you know, that it was Barbie.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: You told me, \"There\\'s no character and there\\'s no story.\" (laugh)\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: Wait. Isn\\'t Barbie a character?\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: No.\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: No. She--\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: She doesn\\'t have, like, a personality-- (laugh)\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: It\\'s a doll. (laugh) And then when I found out we were doing it, sort of actively (laugh) tried to get us out of it. And then -\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: Did you actually try to get out of it?\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Yeah.\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: I made -I made some calls. (laugh) And then -\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: It didn\\'t work? (laugh)\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: No-- because Greta was persistent and Greta saw something.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: I did.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: Greta, what was it you saw?\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: You know, Barbie\\'s been around since 1959, and everyone knows who she is, and everyone has an opinion, and she\\'s run the gamut of being ahead of time, behind time. She\\'s a hero, she\\'s a villain.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig 60 Minutes\\n\\nTogether they created their version of Barbie Land…a feminist utopia. Where every woman is Barbie…and every Ken- is just an accessory.\\n\\nBut an existential crisis in Barbie Land, sends Barbie and Ken into the real world.\\n\\nKen wanders off… discovers patriarchy– and likes it.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: There were people that came out after the movie and said, \"Oh. This movie is anti-man.\"\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: The movie is meant to be a big-hearted thing, even though it\\'s poking fun at everyone. But I had this-- but this is-- but I planned this in my head. I\\'ll just say it.\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: OK.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: But I thought, \"Well, this is not man-hating anymore than Aristophanes\\'s Lysistrata (laugh) was man-hating,\" which is-- does not sound like a sick burn when you say it out loud like that.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: That\\'ll teach \\'em.\\n\\nGerwig invoked a Greek playwright to defend barbie. We noticed her mind seems to percolate with literary references. Baumbach\\'s take on the \"Barbie\" backlash was simpler.\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: I felt men could take it. I mean, t-- come on. (laugh)\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: I mean this sounds so silly to say out loud but I love ken. We love Ken. We also take Ken\\'s position quite seriously.\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: Absolutely.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: I think, like, he has no identity outside of her.\\n\\nGerwig and Baumbach live in New York and wrote the screenplay at home during the pandemic.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: Were you entertaining each other?\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Yes.\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: Yeah. I mean, it kind of kept us sane.\\n\\nOr the insanity went into the movie. They told us the final cut -which at times looks like a COVID fever dream- is very close to the script they submitted to Mattel. The toy maker- they say- was surprisingly hands off– but had notes.\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: One of the notes was, \"On page 112, does a Mattel executive have to be shot?\"\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: And I felt like that was exciting. We knew we were onto something.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: We felt like we might as well go for broke. They\\'re already not making movies.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: You thought it might not ever get made? Yeah.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Yeah. Oh, no. We thought it might never get made.\\n\\nSharyn Alfosni and Greta Gerwig 60 Minutes\\n\\nAnd she says she never dreamed - she\\'d be the one who ended up directing it. Greta Gerwig grew up in Sacramento and fell in love with community theater in grade school. She took up dancing, then acting.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: Did you know you would end up in New York?\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: I–I wanted to be in New York but I just didn\\'t know that I-- it was possible. I mean, it felt (noise) extremely far away and expensive.\\n\\nShe attended Barnard College, performed in school productions. then, fell in with a group of low-budget filmmakers - before setting her sights on a wider audience.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: I remember I walked into a casting director\\'s office. It was, sort of, the heyday of, like-- just a certain look on network television, which I was never very good at doing. I don\\'t know why. But I was wearing overalls. And I remember they-\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: A bold choice. (laugh)\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: She looked up and she goes, \"You must be very talented.\" (laughter)\\n\\nShe landed roles in more than a dozen movies. Some she helped write. Then, Greta Gerwig made the biggest leap of her career from indie darling…to breakout director with \"Lady Bird.\"\\n\\nGerwig wrote the coming-of-age story about the complicated relationship between a mother and daughter.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: The scene where she jumps out of the car, (chuckle) what was your direction?\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: I want you to, without even think about it, just-- just hurl yourself out of this ca-- like, I want it to be almost like you\\'ve acted before you\\'ve thought through completely what the result (chuckle) of this is gonna be.\\n\\nGerwig\\'s fearless approach…earned the then 34-year-old two Oscar nominations.\\n\\nTwo years later, she got a third nomination…for her 2019 adaptation of \"Little Women.\"\\n\\nThen, came \"Barbie\"…with a budget more than ten times that of \"Lady Bird.\"\\n\\nLast month, at a theater in New York, Gerwig showed us some of the old musicals that inspired her…including 1957\\'s \"Funny Face.\"\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Look at the way they\\'re standing. That\\'s not humans Like, those are dancers. That\\'s what I wanted all the Barbies and Kens to look like.\\n\\n\"Barbie\" has that technicolor soundstage look because Gerwig convinced the studio to build one, complete with a painted sky and backdrop to give the movie a 2D effect.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Basically-- the foreground is-- that\\'s on a treadmill. So that\\'s going like this to create movement. And then the lines on the road are being pulled by a person behind it. And it\\'s about showing the work. I wanted to see that it was authentically artificial. Really fake. It\\'s about kids. It\\'s about playing with toys. The language of play has to be part of it.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: We shot this whole thing in one day.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: No.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Yeah. We shot it in one day. We had one day to get it. They were like, if you really want this dream ballet, you\\'re gonna get one day.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: As you sit here in the theater today, it\\'s still amazing to you?\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Yeah. I mean, honestly, the whole movie, when I watch it, I-- I still can\\'t believe anybody let me do this. (laugh)\\n\\nGerwig says they wrote the role of Ken specifically for Ryan Gosling.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: Did you know him?\\n\\nBoth: No.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: I\\'d never met him.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: I mean, you wrote his name, Ryan, in the script?\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Yes. It said, \"Ken: Ryan Gosling.\"\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: It was his full name.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Every other (overtalk) Yeah. We just put his whole name in the whole time.\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: It was a lot to type all the time. (laugh)\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: Did he instantly say, like, \"Yes. I\\'m Ken\"?\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: I basically was like, \"Listen. We\\'ve seen the future. You\\'re in it. And you\\'re Ken.\" (laugh)\\n\\nHang around with Greta Gerwig long enough and a pattern emerges.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Now you\\'re going to see how I get people to do things.\\n\\nShe has a way of coaxing people out of their comfort zones. At a dance studio in Midtown Manhattan…\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Why don\\'t you just come try it though. Just come try it.\\n\\nSharyn Alfosni and Greta Gerwig at a Manhattan dance studio 60 Minutes\\n\\nGerwig directed me to join her as she got back into the swing of one of her first loves…tap dancing.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: This is actually a Proustian moment (laugh)\\n\\nA Proustian moment…during something called a paradiddle. The only thing to do was step aside.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: You\\'re a bit of a perfectionist?\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: I guess so, yes.\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: But you\\'re, like, another take, another take, another take.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Yeah. Yeah. Of course, yeah.\\n\\nOn the set of \"Barbie,\" Gerwig directed nearly 50 takes of this scene with America Ferrera…who plays a Mattel assistant and mother.\\n\\nSoul-baring monologues, penned by Gerwig, are a staple of her films. The writer\\'s version of a guitar solo.\\n\\nNoah Baumbach: Greta will go into some monologue mode, it\\'s kind of almost physical. Like, she goes in and she just like-- and kind of like, (laugh) doing a thing and, like, you know, it\\'s like Joe Cocker or something. (laugh) it\\'s like -and then, she hands it over. And-- and it\\'s great.\\n\\nNext, Gerwig is taking on a big franchise. She\\'s directing and writing two \"Chronicles of Narnia\" movies. She confessed putting her stamp on the beloved C.S. Lewis classics is giving her nightmares.\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: Yeah, whenever I\\'m stuck, I go for walks--\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: Do you get--\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: --which is most of the time?\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: Do you get stuck?\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: That\\'s all I\\'ve been--\\n\\nSharyn Alfonsi: I feel like its flowing out of you–\\n\\nGreta Gerwig: That\\'s all I do. I only get stuck. That\\'s all I re-- that\\'s why I\\'m always going on walks. (laugh)\\n\\nWhatever she\\'s doing, it\\'s paying off. Greta Gerwig is the first woman to solo-direct a billion dollar movie…an idea that once seemed as far-fetched as Barbie in Birkenstocks.\\n\\nProduced by Nathalie Sommer.
